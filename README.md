- 👋 Hi, I’m @iLikePizza1000101
- 👀 I’m interested in alot of things, from planting trees to techno; my main reasom for being here is my strong desire to become a Software Engineer.
- 🌱 I’m currently learning JavaScript, methodologies and principles for the way Software Engineers work (such as Agile and Dev Ops). I am currently building the back-end of a board game I own called Pandemic in Python 3.0. Been really good fun and a great learning experience so far!
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on the game I am building and also on other projects, particularly those that are focussed om JS Ffront end development so I can start developing my skills in that area.
